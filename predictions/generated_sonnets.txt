Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
What lines that the sigh that I'll never forget
How hard I'll vow never to let go,
In any book that I forget,
Not from memory the pleasure of my wit;
In what golden tombs can I hear,
Even from the eyes of all posterity
That sing praises of God's eternal love.
Yet here I am, pure and simple,
Without all ornament, with no praise,
But only in certain words, still tongues love
  And all over again.


1
Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,
Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
As the basest worms in the sweetestest buds,
Feeding the fire with vile poison,
And releasing it with sullen force,
O'ercharged with too much fear,
Dulling the earth and burning it up with sullen fire,
Increasing store with decreasing burden,
And losing sight of thee on the dial,
O'ercharged with vengeful affections intent,
And losing husband to lust after his wife's body,
And woman to be ground zero
By intermixed lust and husband to dominate,
  All this I do plead before thee


2
My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
And thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother;
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother's son,
To give all that she gave thee to give.
Then thou hast but made a husbandry out of defects
Which nature took to be, and now she lends;
For what then of thee thy husbandry doth make,
Nor let him take nor depend upon thee.
  To be so depended upon was to be wanting,
  And so should be thy lasting love.


3
O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
And all my loving thoughts, every book in my head,
Feeds on thoughts that do not quite belong?
O, 'tis true, they breathe; yet I am no painter,
Nor think their perfumes in the nostrils.
They are famished, I am said,
For they look but in the painted world,
Which we admiring look but do not know
Time's graces and fair tones.
  Their pipe shows how they smoke,
  Which is so applauded in the pipe we see,
  Which is sweet and so hated is taste.

Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot thou art,
And therefore do not call thee niggard,
Although thou hast an all powerful mind, gentle heart,
And gentle manners, to kiss and fondly bow.
Thou hast passed by the storm that struck me last,
And settled in a winter's night,
Within the gentle control of my tongue
Makes me tongue-tied, to his broad thoughts;
And though tongues think thee unbounded,
My soul holds so unkind
As well as any that my tongue breeds.
  But think on me when thou my sweet self forgetst,
  And I lose count


5
O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
Upon thy side against myself shalt thou haply stand.
For gluttoning on abundance leads to filching,
And from his abundance comes lust, and from his hungry son
Shall new born meet, and old age remove.
For old age sooth false painting, now true,
And style so false my seeing must be,
Since every shadow of my true self here surmount,
And nothing new nor attainted new tell.
  For there is no holy war here,
  Where strength, love, or age can cross but by.


6
Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
Against my will do I slandered;
Against thy will do I persecute
And cut short my pleasure;
Against my will do I strangle and dread my life's composition;
For fear of whom, gentle cheater,
I will strangle and hang o'ers with teeth;
Against thy will do I lace my hair and lace my nails;
And do this, and do it well:
  Till you deem me wise, do not confine my judgment
  To what I wish my executor should do.


7
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn
Than when thou art dead.
For why should new-found love refigy
Take root in old habits and creeds,
And new faith debate, till first a brand new
Is given thee teeming heir?
O, 'tis true, but love knows it is a lie;
And old habits and creeds with false teachers
Alack thee to a modern invention.
  For thee and for thyself against myself I'll hound,
  As stol'nage a conquered town, bide each man for sport.

Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
In sulphurous clay the living bee's brood;
A ruined livery made for an antique shop
Robbished for tattered mud;
An excellent governess bore the title Roman,
And married to the wanton haste
Of times gone amiss, seldom seen
Yet noted still for goodness and beauty.
Another time the woman wailed at his burning
And, drunk with grief, fell to her husband's sword;
Another time, though not yet sick, he resolved,
Making widow beauteous her husband's rage,
And married to the wanton thrift
Of times spent to


9
The little love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
Still make heaven their oyster,
Yet in the burning sun they bore,
Like widowed wombs after their lords' decease.
For summer's veil doth cover every blot
But the nearness of his youthful face,
Which nightly tears the clear air with;
And for his widow smiling still doth live,
Despite all her lovers' cruel oath,
Bearing their sweet deaths a holy look.
  Yet heaven for this sin did remove
  From her, that by and by she should live,
  As still his with lovers after themselves decease.


10
When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
When in high society grace is crowned a god,
And makes no slight widow seem.
When thou lookest on my beauty, thou gild'st a blessed husband;
Then beauty's rose is but the pebbled rose
Which at the base of a noble bud doth stand,
And like a jewel doth her give.
Look on my cheek, thou gild'st a glorious sight,
But beauty lies that thou cannot see
To show me thy false self with false reproach.
  But look on me when thou wilt, and thou gild'st true self to shame


11
Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
That like two spirits do suggest me still.
My better angel is a man right fair,
And her love degrades not as sweet,
As mine is more bitter than sweet's mark.
Our earth is but one, and husbanding
Is an ever-fixed mark of beauty's past.
Our dates are brief, and therefore summer's lease
Sets the babe on the summer's long row,
And sweets and smells degrade not so much.
  But honey, which in our summer bakes
  Much of that sweet smell, much of it dead.
