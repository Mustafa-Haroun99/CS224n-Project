Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
Called by sad to seek some that better signsites' sake
In his eager state to
From that gracious under which she gamed.
But for his bloody hand, proud of many,
A vulgar song gave hymns word of hisose;
And he taught or why, I none knows.
  But as for me, here in this be,
  My love is still my dear self-love,
  And he that doth this I cannot blame,
  Since what he owes me I by allure doth, thee.


1
Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,
Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
When in outward grace thou grow'st?
O, know what thy love for truth doth feel;
All this loving thought, all this poor praise,
Cannot make thee quite contrary joy;
Yet on thy part it throw'st heavily,
As whereun, by gentle replying,
Thyself provoke'st thy nature to be worse.
O, love, what thy fortification do
Thy outward honoring seem'st, but what?
O, think what thy love did look like in the spring days,
When soft and gracious birds sang in Phil's sweet song.



2
My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
And will in his absence some fresh substance
That by feeding on thee thine age may give.
So fears I, when I was not,
Or thought unprovident do callous deaths,
As that fearful captain unused to show his pride,
Plucked out for the quick return of felled hate.
O, give my love of that thou knowest not cruel.
Thou mayst be thy brave self if thou wilt thy sweet time,
; but that thou shouldst die,
And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe shalt steal.
  The world may but thank


3
O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
That I impair not only my sight,
But impair not even the surety of heaven?
O know, sweet love, I always read and stifled love;
But, for thy' sake love, I impair not love
And am almost, of nothing, by a partaking in head;
So that for thy' great worth do'st I dispense,
Anding the gainers salaces, bringers of had
  In continual wink and with slow motion ill cheer.


4
Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot thee,
Or else love is a most wanting show?
Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:
Thou dost love her because thou know'st I love her,
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
Suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her.
If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
And losing her, my friend hath found that loss.
  Since I cannot lose her, then I have found thee;
  And so she loves her, and me by her
  Then we must but sum; my loss


5
O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
To trust the shadow of a second self forgot,
Whate'er better being for still my moving.
O, what a mansion have I been debarred the right
To enjoy the spends of thy time doth heist,
The quiet,
Not to say with enjoy even the lack,
Of something to show or make remembered.
  So fair a mansion have I seen,
  Save where thou art the gainer, thou being kept.


6
Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
For you in me well know slander, black.
O, change not! then change your feature new,
And in my praise with my old flatterer blunt,
Making wart pity, like him you recount,
Making worse abuses still more, still worse being extant?
I will be gone, 'tis true, but you still shall hear.
So, change your beak and say amen
To every outward mark thus made,
Even to the world, so that I may see how it is
Feeds on, and looks for a joy therein of yourry.
  In so we change not


7
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn.
Thou that art so unprovident sorrow'st shalt,
And to thyself shalt owe leave to die,
If not hast some loving hours o'er- of hand,
To give another time's bear.
O let gentle seasons blessings spread youth's sweet love,
And tender wards. thou frame'st thy decay
With art of loving dost compound thy show.
  Make thee another self for love of me,
  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.


8
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep him in,
Int'ring this sorry succession with a title.
But when from dregs of shame got hold sweet,
And needy love as doth from desire grind,
Cly with his lays exchanged, another fell lame,
And care no longer had more substance than feathers.
So he grew in fo general disgrace,
And almost thence dyed his hand
And burned the records of his age to make new.
  But thou, thyself thou and art so bright
  That now thy speechless life and tongue print more.


9
The little love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
From dancing the show of youth's wear,
With mother's eyes drowsed and bareness in boldness,
Ruined for joy and all alone
C things indigest in death's purify for taste.
O, let poor buried love adore his aspect
And soon see him borne from the,
Whose monument to love should be kept,
Or victor to all posterity.
  Blessed are they whose parts of thee were true,
  Being first dead and never coming home alive.


10
When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
After myself delivered from your hand.
That young woman holds's invention in worth,
As I myself am your slave, to whom you give too much;
And, for my sake, even so with public looks,
 being wooed so idly,
I give for my love what I receive.
Yet in so great kindness do I dispense,
That I hope my love's story shall evermore tell,
And many maiden favorites praise her beauty and tell it wrong,
  Lascivious yet seem true.


11
Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
That like two spirits do suggest me still.
My better angel is a man right fair,
And in him I found my verse meet,
But he methinks I am a god in love.
So then I cannot say more how I joy
Or more praise to that part of you whose shadow
I see fairly.
I may tell turns of the night where I abide,
And found praises of thy worth stills at hand,
But like them thou blachest not mine,
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds.
  Lascivious sighs make now my wailing,
  And black canker vice within me still.
