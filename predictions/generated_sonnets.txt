Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
And for that sorrow which I thought buried
Needs must be unwrimmed,
Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.
For if the nerves were brass or hammered steel,
For if the lines of brass or hammered steel,
For if they were brass or hammered steel,
Of masonry or hammered steel,
I could not then be brass or hammered steel.
 I had seen brass or hammered steel be
Hath motion, but this seemed to me
To truths translated and for true things deemed.
  To this I learn, and find the lesson true:
  Drugs poison him that so

Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,
Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
When thou art assured mine own of thy fair use
And use it to thy advantage.
When thou art not, though thou art, like a deceived husband;
Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight;
Past reason hunted, and no sooner hadst his spoil.
Past reason hated as a swallowed bait
On purpose laid to make the taker mad.
Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;
A bliss in proof and proved a very woe.
  All this the world well knows, yet none knows well
  To shun the heaven

My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
Like feeble age, which now appear
But that thou mayst true love with that burden thine alone.
Let this sad int'rim like the ocean be
Which parts the shore where two contracted new
Come daily to the banks, that, when they see they are, they are, they say they are but stewards of their excellence.
Be where the lines of life are expressed,
Which, when they see thee, they say they err;
  And so they keep their boat, which is to the wide world.

O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
And in whose love to thee,
As I, whom in thy breast doth lie.
I am not sure whether doth my mind,
Or whether doth love, or shall I say,
That love is not mixed with seconds, knows no art
Time's love, nor me nor you
To make me much outlive a gilded tomb
Which Time will hence remain unused, unused, unused, and to be.
  Therefore, till the judgment that leads me to believe
  I am false, and yet I must live,
  Where time and outward form would show it dead.

Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot to say
That thou forget to say
The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
Which proves thievish for women's eyes.
I love you in such strife as this,
Which proves more nearly a done thing
That looks fair, in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.
I have seen roses damasked and red;
But, for my love thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate
That 'gainst my love's use
If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state.
  But do not so. I love thee in such sort
  As, thou being


5
O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
And to make sure that my lie would change.
I have no fear from thence.
And yet fearfully my heart in other place
To be won; by him advantage should achieve
And lace itself with my love,
Hath put a mortal in my heart,
Which by him advantage should achieve
And lace itself with his society?
O, no. Thy love, be it not so great,
Doth great prove me worthy of that love's fine wit.
  Then should I dare to boast how I do love thee;
  Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove


6
Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
To set a form upon desired change,
As I'll myself disgrace, knowing thy will;
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,
Be absent from thy walks, and in my tongue
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong
And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
  For thee, against myself I'll vow debate,
  For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.


7
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn;
And all those bett'ring for me.
For thy love remembered such wealth brings
That I in thee behold,
Called to that sweet ornament which is so dear
That when it is built anew,
Or as the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
  For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
  That then thou forget'st so long.

Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
The golden tresses of his former self-love,
Which have now their lives virtuous lie.
I in thy course untainted do allow
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
So, when thou art master now,
Then thou art blamed shall not for my love thou art.
Thou canst not, to thyself at least,
To be blamed if thou thyself dost.
  blame is thy love that leads men to this heinous crime,
  That do not so.

The little love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep his seat,
And precious phrase by all the muses filed.
Named after you, let your love even with this madding fever!
O, let your love even with this madding fever!
Let your love even with this madding fever!
O, let your love even with this madding fever!
O, let your love even with this madding fever!
  Let your love even with this madding fever!
  But if your love were better,
  it is so preposterously made.


10
When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
As she wrought thee for her skill,
That she may well be false in this,
And yet we must be twain
By new unfolding her bending all bare,
Like feeble age, where thou art,
Despite of your possessing,
That she may detain, but not still keep, your name.
Her audit, though delayed, answered must be,
And her quietus is to render thee.
Her quietus is to render thee for her quietus,
Which shall be much more than gentle work.
  To leave her quietus is to render thee for her quietus,
  And

Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
That like two spirits do suggest me still.
My better angel is a man right fair,
And for that man in whose goodness doth depend.
For since from thee my poor lips,
I must by fortune to pluck thee where thou art,
And in the hours and weeks,
To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
If thou wouldst answer "This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,"
Proving his beauty by succession thine.
  But since from thee I'll vow debate,
  For I must
