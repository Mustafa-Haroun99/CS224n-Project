Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
My lips that gave thee that due,
As those that gave thee so belong now.
Now that my verse is writ in praise,
And those same lips that said I loved thee then
Were wont to the same pen,
One blazoned with thy fair name,
To say my most full praise of that verse.
  Since then she hath not said more,
  I can scarcely say my love, though some say I do.


1
Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,
Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
Like widowed wombs after their lords' decease.
For where is she so blessed that fears no blot,
Like widowed wombs after their lords' decease?
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
Of his decease, to stop posterity?
O, him thou hast the strength of all the world's eyes,
And he that doth her, she herself sheds blood;
  And he that doth her, she in his will,
  Worldwide gainst her and she in him.


2
My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
Doth but the thing that grows;
For sweet love looks ever so, even to the end,
As when it was first made sickly;
But when it grows strong, though in pieces weak,
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From the dead, it razed quite,
And Death to itself reigned, as the world's fresh
Sinks down to the level of death.
  So of you, be of my thoughts when I write,
  Even so as I may your sweet love remember.


3
O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
And what free will will will will I have with my heart
If it shrink from you?
O, what a mansion have those antique eyes
Which in thy glass showtering have stol'n,
Which have stol'n not figured out thy glass folly,
Or given grace a double majesty;
Yet in them thy sweet beauty is stol'n,
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me;
  Or who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
  Which, like a dial hand, is not Time's sole art.

Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot thee
And didst write of thy lovely argument;
And yet love is a thing that touches me more;
Therefore in that I canst not know thy change.
In many's looks, the false heart's history
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.
But heaven in thy creation did decree
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be,
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.
  How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
  If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.


5
O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
As thou art blamed if thou steal thyself away.
For whence, thou art blamed, is it not thy will
To blame those in whom thou art blamed,
Or those in whom thou art blamed whom thou art blamed
To steal thyself away?
O, from thy sweet love's delight, why should I not chide thee
When thou steal thyself from me, that thou mayst prove
My love, my love's right?
  O, him who lives for love, my love's right.
  If my beloved friend, whom thou dost love, my love's wrong.


6
Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
To mar the pleasing show of your wit.
So you, my lovely boy, who in thy power
Doth willfully appear rude,
To mar the very show of your worth;
And like a willing patient, will be
The Body's doctor, to whom my love's wound is discharged.
But you, whose worthiness lies in thy love's face,
Thou of worth, truly doth transfix my malady.
  For thou gav'st my malady thy love commits,
  And thence this slander as I think proceeds.


7
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn
Thy lover's hand against thy breast;
In him thy sweet love is attainted
And all oblivious parts removed,
For still my love hath still the strength of thee.
So then thou hast but lost the love of me,
Thou hast but lost the pleasure of me being sworn,
And lost the pleasure of me being false in thy heart.
  This is my thought, that love is thought;
  Till then, love is not thought, but feeling.


8
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
The lovely maiden in the hottest of days.
Thee were not his enemies, nor he his enemies
But lovers of their fair complexion,
Whilst he, whom nature hath not made so clear,
As victors of my love's riot can boast,
Being fond on praise, preferred mine own.
O, in what sweets I most enjoy,
Thee being full of your love,
The other half oblivious, to my slight defect.
  In him those sweet sweet deaths whose sweet odor
  Leese with that which it was sweetly poisoned.


9
The little love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
From the world's eye, now his are gone,
Save that his sacred majesty may still shine
In beauty's eternal course.
O, change! that doth beauty, like a dial hand,
Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;
So your love's beauty still doth stand,
Even in the burning bush, where it must die.
  But, ah, your love's flame no longer doth burn,
  And, like a dial hand, it doth change course.


10
When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
When in truth she hath her eye to play.
When my love's dear love's lease is expired,
My beloved as shelived,
As shelived in thee, so she will live,
Although I forbid her to go out of my sight,
To change my mind, though I never see her do it;
  And thou in this shalt find thy monument
  When love's sweet veil doth cover every blot.


11
Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
That like two spirits do suggest me still.
My better angel is a man right fair,
And like him is false replete with blame;
Yet him is as fair in seeing evil done,
As in granting that right.
For why should I then be wary of false repute,
When in the canopy of his loving head
Thy loving eyes may be seen to my liking?
Or on thy part are ghostly hours ruined,
When in thy sweet self thou gild'st thy beauty's brow?
  Love's brow is thy seat, and thou gild'st it when it gild'st thou.
