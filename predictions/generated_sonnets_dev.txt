Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place.
For there can live no hatred in thine eye;
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.
In many's looks, the false heart's history
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.
But heaven in thy creation did decree
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be,
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.
  How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
  If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.


1
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me.
Is 't not enough to torture me alone,
For still temptation follows where I am?
O, no. 't is so, though I feel it not.
For 't lies in me that I may trust no more,
Than 't lies in me to trust no more.
O, what a mansion have those vices got
Which for their habitation chose out thee,
Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,
And all things turns to fair that eyes can see!
  But heaven in thy creation did decree
  That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell.


2
So, now I have confessed that he is thine
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine is free.
He hath no exchequer now but his,
And no exchequer surmise, no exchequer surmise,
And no exchequer surmise,
He only pays what is had,
And pays it thee where thou art.
He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word
From thy behavior; beauty doth he give
And found it in thy cheek. He can afford
No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.
  Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
  Since what he owes thee thou thyself


3
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
And will to boot, and will in overplus.
More than enough am I that vex thee still,
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure,
Than those tears that besiege all kinds of blood.
I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
Nor thou with public kindness honor me
Unless thou take that honor from thy name.
  But do not so. I love thee in such sort
  As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.


4
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy will,
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there.
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
Of thy worth, thy height, being made of four,
With beauty's best conceit so great,
As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air.
In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be.
  But thou art all my art and dost advance
  As high as learning my rude ignorance.


5
Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
And they thine own bright eyes are bright.
So thou, in whom thy fair imperfect shade shines,
Thyself thy shade shines even so!
But in those eyes thy fair imperfect shade
Of mouthed graves will show thee how thy shadow's form
Hath traveled on to age's steepy night,
And all those beauties whereof now thou grow'st
Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
Stealing away the treasure of thy lusty days.
  These beauties, so oft as thou wilt look,
  Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.


6
When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
But that I, too much profane,
Unlooked for joy in that I mayst owe.
I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
Nor thou with public kindness honor me
Unless thou take that honor from thy name.
  But do not so. I love thee in such sort
  As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
  Receiving that which is not, knows no cause why.


7
O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
For that same tongue that tells the story of thy days,
Making lascivious comments on thy sport,
Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;
Naming thy name blesses an ill report.
O, what a mansion have those vices got
Which for their habitation chose out thee,
Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,
And all things turns to fair that eyes can see!
  Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;
  The hardest knife ill used doth lose his edge.


8
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain,
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express their strength.
O, what a happy title do I find,
Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
What a happy title do I find,
Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
What a happy title do I find,
Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
What a happy title do I find,
Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
  But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
  Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.


9
In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
And my soul that bears the record.
For how do I perceive thee, then,
In what sweets dost thou thy thoughts bring forth,
Or in their sweet sauces dost thou make the shame.
In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be.
  But thou art all my art, and I in thee
  All art of thee, and I in thee.


10
Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
And my state with manners rank compare,
As then my state is best acquainted,
And my state with manners rank compare.
So then my state is best if I canst without thy help,
Being made from thee, I am one hour mine;
And by this my state, being made from thee,
I am one hour mine, the other as thy sweet self grow'st.
  Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
  Or gluttoning on all, or all away.


11
Lo, as a careful huswife runs to catch
One of her feathered creatures broke away,
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch.
O, what a happy title do I find,
Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
Yet what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like a willing patient,
I will every penny give;
And even so will she keep you as my chest,
As, having such a gift confounded,
She keeps you as her quietus,
Which, being full of your woe,
She may detain, even hours,
Her own life and all her joy.
  But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
