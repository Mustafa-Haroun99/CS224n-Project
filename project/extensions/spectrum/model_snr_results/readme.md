# Model Results

This folder contains a collection of pre-scanned spectrum results for various models. If you find models that are not already included here, we encourage you to submit a Pull Request (PR) to add those results. We will continue to update this repository as we use spectrum in our models.

## Usage

```bash
python spectrum.py --model-name <model-name> --top-percent <the top % of SNR modules you want to target>
```
